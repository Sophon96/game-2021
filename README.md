# game-2021

This is the repository for the Davis Senior High School Gamedev game of the
2021-22 school year.

# Build Instructions

## Dependencies
This project will be done with OpenGL, which must be at least version 3.3 on
your device.

GLFW is packaged as a submodule, and it built along with the game, so it is not
necessary to install it separately.

## Build
Checkout the GLFW submodule with

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then run `./scripts/build.sh` for bash, or `.\scripts\build.bat` for cmd/PowerShell.

## Run
The built game is located under `build/` with the name `game21`. Depending on
your platform, there may be extra folders and/or a suffix after the file name.

## Controls
- A key / left arrow key - left
- D key / right arrow key - right
- Space bar / up arrow key - jump
- Escape key - exit

## For Coders
The main method is in `src/main/main.cpp` if you want to start exploring there.
